# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple web-based game allows players to guess a random number between 1 and 100. Test your guessing skills and see if you can guess the correct number within a limited number of chances.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. You will see a header that says "Guess a number from 1 to 100."

3. Below the header, there is an input field where you can enter your guess.

4. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field.

5. Click the "Check" button to submit your guess.

6. You will receive feedback based on your guess:
   - If your guess is correct, you will see "Congratulations" in green text, and the input field will be disabled. You can click the "Replay" button to play again.
   - If your guess is higher than the random number, you will see "Your guess is high" in black text, along with the number of remaining chances.
   - If your guess is lower than the random number, you will see "Your guess is low" in black text, along with the number of remaining chances.
   - If you enter an invalid number (outside the 1-100 range), you will see "Your number is invalid" in red text.

7. You have a total of 10 chances to guess the correct number. If you run out of chances, you will see "You lost the game" in red text, and the input field will be disabled. Click the "Replay" button to start a new game.
